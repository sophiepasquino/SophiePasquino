## Hi there 👋

🗣 I'm @SophiePasquino, Founder’s Associate at Pandektes, World Economic Forum Global Shaper, and University of Cambridge graduate.
📊 I'm interested in venture capital, financial regulation, and how legal systems shape innovation, entrepreneurship, and financial markets.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to integrate data and tech into legal decision-making, using SQL and Python.
👯 I would love to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects at the intersection of law, finance, entrepreneurship, and policy, including fintech regulation, fund governance, and market regulation.
👾 For fun, I explore interdisciplinary projects across law, tech, and policy, and I enjoy running, travelling, and building research side-projects.
